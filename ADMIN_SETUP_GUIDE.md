## Key Features

### üîí Security Features
- **Custom Login URLs**: Hide your admin panel with unique, customizable URLs
- **Strong Password Requirements**: Enforced 12+ character passwords with complexity rules
- **Account Lockout**: Automatic protection against brute force attacks

### üõ°Ô∏è Password Requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

### üîó URL Management
- Generate secure, random login URLs

- URLs use only safe characters (letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your First Admin User

Run the interactive setup script:

```bash
python create_admin.py
```

This will guide you through:
- Creating your admin username and email
- Setting a secure password
- Choosing a custom login URL (or auto-generating one)

### Step 2: Access Your Admin Panel

Once created, you can access your admin panel at:
```
https://yoursite.com/your-custom-url
```

## Admin Management

### Command Line Tools

Use the admin management utility for advanced operations:

```bash
# List all admin users
python admin_management.py list

# Unlock a locked account
python admin_management.py unlock -u username

# Change password
python admin_management.py password -u username

# Generate new login URL
python admin_management.py url -u username

# Deactivate/activate account
python admin_management.py deactivate -u username
python admin_management.py activate -u username

# Security audit
python admin_management.py audit
```

### Web Interface

Access these features through your admin panel:

1. **Login**: Use your custom URL to access the secure login page
2. **Dashboard**: View and manage website inquiries and projects
3. **Settings**: Change passwords, update login URLs, view security status
4. **Password Change**: Update your password with security validation

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Custom Login URLs

- Use complex URLs that aren't easily guessable
- Consider using random generated URLs for maximum security

### 2. Password Management

- Update passwords every 90 days
- Never reuse passwords from other accounts
- Consider using a password manager

### 3. Account Security

- Use secure connections (HTTPS) only
- Regularly run security audits

### 4. Access Control
- Only create admin accounts when necessary
- Deactivate unused accounts
- Review account activity regularly
- Use account lockout features

## Available Routes

### Public Routes (No Authentication)
- `/admin/setup` - First-time admin setup (only if no admin exists)

### Dynamic Login Routes

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The system adds an `admin_users` table with:
- User credentials (username, email, password hash)
- Security settings (custom URLs, lockout status)
- Audit information (login attempts, timestamps)
- Account status (active/inactive, password age)

### Security Features
- Password hashing with Werkzeug
- Session management with Flask-Login
- CSRF protection on all forms
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection with input escaping

### Integration
- Works alongside existing Replit OAuth system
- Maintains existing admin functionality
- Backwards compatible with current admin routes
- Secure session handling

## Troubleshooting

2. Check if account is locked (wait 30 minutes or use unlock command)
3. Ensure account is active
4. Confirm password meets requirements
