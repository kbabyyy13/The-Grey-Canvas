
More Than Code: The Story Behind The Grey Canvas

Every great business starts with a "why." It’s the reason you get up in the morning, the purpose that pushes you through the tough days, and the mission that makes it all worthwhile. For some, it’s about chasing a lifelong passion. For others, like me, it’s about building a better future on a blank canvas that life unexpectedly hands you.
My name is Krysta McAlister, and I’m the founder of The Grey Canvas. But before I was a web developer, I was a single mom of three with a background in education, trying to navigate a world that had been turned upside down. My journey into tech wasn't just a career change; it was an act of love, resilience, and a promise to my kids—and to the memory of my late father, who was my greatest champion.
He always believed in me, and when he was gone, I knew I had to believe in myself with that same fierce conviction.
From Paraprofessional to Programmer
Teaching myself to code wasn't easy. There were late nights, moments of doubt, and a steep learning curve. But I was driven by a powerful motivation: to show my children that no obstacle is too big to overcome. I wanted them to see that their mom, with a dream and a laptop, could change the game for our family.
That journey led me to a Meta Back-End Developer certification and an AAS in Software Development. More importantly, it led me to my true calling: helping other people build their own dreams.
My time as the Director of Digital and Business Development for a local plumbing company was where it all clicked. I saw firsthand the challenges small business owners face. They are experts in their trade—be it plumbing, construction, or real estate—but they often don't have the time or resources to build a digital presence that truly reflects their skill and hard work.
Why "The Grey Canvas"?
I started The Grey Canvas because I understand that feeling of starting with a blank slate. It can be intimidating, but it’s also where the most beautiful possibilities lie. My mission is to be the partner who helps you turn that empty canvas into a masterpiece.




This business is more than just code and design. It’s built on the values that got me here:
Grit: I know the grind, and I bring that work ethic to every project.
Empathy: I understand the pressures you face because I’ve been there.
Integrity: I believe in honest, transparent work that delivers real results.
When you work with The Grey Canvas, you’re not just hiring a developer. You’re partnering with someone who is personally invested in your success, because your story of growth and perseverance is my story, too.

Whether you're a contractor in Dallas needing a professional site, a real estate agent in Fort Worth looking to stand out, or a freelancer in Denton ready to take your business to the next level, I'm here to help you build a digital foundation that works as hard as you do.
Because at the end of the day, we’re all just trying to build something meaningful on the canvas we’ve been given.
